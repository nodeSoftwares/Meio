## FAQ

#### Does it work on linux ?
As we are using C# and Avalonia, it should be available through all platforms (except mobile platforms at the moment).

#### Does it have support on android
Based on the project yes, but this support will come after because we actually develop the linux and the windows version of the app.

#### Which music service does it support
Right now, it can only fetch some basic information from youtube music but in the future obviously we will add music playing (The software is in it's really really reaaaally early stages of development).
